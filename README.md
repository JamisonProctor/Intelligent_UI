## About

Introducing Intelligent UI, where we're dedicated to making interactions with Language Models (LLMs) more accessible and immersive. No longer confined to ordinary text-based conversations with LLMs, we're here to transform your experience into something extraordinary.

Our secret sauce? Intelligent UI. We've harnessed the immense power of LLMs to dynamically craft contextual UI elements on the fly. These UI elements not only deepen the interaction but also serve as subtle guides for a seamless LLM experience.
